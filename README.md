# VMC Core (vmc)

Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) defines a detector simulation framework that allows to run different simulation Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input and output format as well as the geometry and detector response definition.

This package, **vmc**,  provides the core interfaces and classes independent from the Monte Carlo transport codes.
